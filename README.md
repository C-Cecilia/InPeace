# 🕊️ InPeace - Quiet Place Finder Web Application

> **InPeace** is a web application designed to help users discover quiet places in Manhattan, New York, catering especially to introverts seeking peaceful spaces. This application combines data from New York's transportation and weather sources to predict busyness levels, offering users a unique experience for finding tranquil locations. Developed by **Group 12** for the COMP30830 Software Engineering course at University College Dublin.


## 📋 Project Overview

The InPeace application is a comprehensive tool that integrates live data and predictive modeling to assist users in navigating Manhattan's quieter areas. Key features include a **busyness prediction model** for specific locations, a **community board** for social interaction, and a **recommendation system** for user-preferred quiet places.

Users can register, search for peaceful spots, and join discussions on the community board. The app is deployed with a microservice architecture and hosted on Google Cloud.


## 🌟 Features

- **Busyness Prediction**: Uses machine learning to forecast busyness levels based on transportation and weather data.
- **Quiet Place Recommendations**: Suggests locations based on user preferences.
- **Community Board**: Allows users to connect, share experiences, and find common interests.
- **Interactive Map**: View locations and busyness predictions on a map interface with clustering and dynamic updates.
